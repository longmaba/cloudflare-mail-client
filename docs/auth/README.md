# Doota authentication

Doota is self-hosted: **one deployment = one company = one mail domain**
(`user@domain.tld`). The fact that shapes the whole auth design:

> A user's login identity **is** their Doota mailbox, which they cannot read
> until they are logged in.

So any recovery that emails the Doota address is circular and forbidden.
Recovery goes to a **different, external** address.

> Current as of 2026-08-02. This covers **human login/identity** (Better Auth
> sessions, roles, org=domain). Machine sending uses a separate credential —
> `dk_…` service-account API keys — documented in
> [`../service-accounts.md`](../service-accounts.md), not here. The full
> environment/secrets reference is in [`../pre-release.md`](../pre-release.md) §0.3.

## Map of the code

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/lib/server/auth.ts` | Better Auth config — the core. Recovery-email override, roles, org plugin, hooks, rate limits |
| `src/hooks.server.ts` | Mounts auth, loads session, runs the onboarding gate |
| `src/lib/server/onboarding.ts` | Derives remaining onboarding steps per role; `markOnboarded` / `onboardingHome` |
| `src/lib/server/org-domains.ts` | domain→org cache; `isServedDomain()` / `orgForDomain()` |
| `src/lib/server/cloudflare.ts` | ONLY caller of the CF API — idempotent zone create/poll + mail wiring (routing, DNS, DKIM, catch-all). Never on the hot path |
| `src/lib/server/can.ts` | `can()` — the single authorization chokepoint |
| `src/lib/server/provisioning.ts` | Admin provisions a member/admin under an `active` org + invite mail |
| `src/lib/server/password-reset.ts` | Logged-in reset code: mail + verify (`pwreset:*`) |
| `src/lib/server/recovery-email.ts` | Set / verify the external recovery email |
| `src/lib/server/mailer.ts` | System mailer (`no-reply@domain`) + background send |
| `src/lib/rpc/setup.remote.ts` | Email-free genesis wizard (userCount==0 + `SETUP_TOKEN`) |
| `src/lib/rpc/domains.remote.ts` | Super-admin domain onboarding + status poll (drives `cloudflare.ts`) |
| `src/lib/rpc/manage-users.remote.ts` | Create / pause / remove org members (gated by `can()`) |
| `src/lib/rpc/onboarding.remote.ts` | Set-password onboarding step |
| `src/lib/rpc/reset-password.remote.ts` | Authenticated change-password dialog backend |
| `src/lib/rpc/recovery-email.remote.ts` | Recovery email set + deferred super-admin email verify |
| `src/lib/client/auth-client.ts` | Better Auth browser client |
| `scripts/reset-admin.mjs` | Existing-superadmin recovery CLI with a masked password prompt and session revocation |
| Routes | `setup/`, `(onboarding)/`, `(app)/`, `(admin)/admin/{organizations,domains,settings}/`, `login/`, `forgot-password/`, `reset-password/`, `verify-recovery-email/`, `(app)/account/security/` |
